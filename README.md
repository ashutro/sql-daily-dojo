## 📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my day-by-day SQL learning journey.  
Each day I solve one or more SQL problems, focusing on:

- Window functions (`OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, frames)
- Time-series techniques (handling missing dates, gaps, nulls)
- Cumulative analytics (running totals, rolling windows)
- Practical PostgreSQL patterns
- Real world data engineering and analytics logic

All solutions are written **exclusively in PostgreSQL**.
